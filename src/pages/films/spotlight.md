The only thing I really have to say on Spotlight is this:

**You must watch it.**


The film follows a group of reporters at the Boston globe uncover a wide scale
cover up of child abuse within Catholic Archdiocese. Reminiscent of [All The 
President's Men](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074119/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), the
gentle build of momentum from the almost inane first lead to the crashing
waterfall implicated priests and the countless victims left in their wake was
exhilirating.

McCarthy builds momentum expertly. Sweeping the viewer up into the ebbs and
flows of the story. The dead ends, the not-so-dead ends. The sheer scale of it 
all. It's extraordinary.

Excellent casting and particularly superb performances from Rachel McAdams and
Mark Ruffalo.
