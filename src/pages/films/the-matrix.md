Hannah wanted to watch this because it comes up a lot in spritiual analogies 
to do with finding yourself and awakening your true self and she wanted to 
understand what the reference was. I was delighted to oblige. The first time I
watched this film I was maybe 15 years old at a nerdy sleepover and I remember
it being a blast.

Despite it's age and reputation, The Matrix holds up. I would argue a genuinely
good film, great narrative, great fights. In this film the CGI is over the top
but by just the right amount - the sequels are where things get truly silly. 

What I enjoyed the most about the film though was realising just how 90's it
was. Some of the dialogue was laugh out loud cliche, and reminded me that this 
film is one that doesn't take itself too seriously and you, the viewer, 
shouldn't either. Here are some of my favourites:
- "So what do you need? Besides a miracle...", "Guns. Lots of guns"
- "What are you trying to tell me? That I can dodge bullets?" "No Neo, I'm
trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to"
- "There is no spoon"
