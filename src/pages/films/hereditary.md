After seeing Midsommar and talking to people about how much I enjoyed it I was
told repeatedly that I *had* to watch Hereditary. People getting giddy at the
thought of it. Well, I finally watched it, and oh boy what a ride.

The opening hour is my favourite of the film, it really throws you right in at
the deep end. My jaw was on the floor for a good 20 minutes after that scene.
I've not known a film to put me so on edge so quickly and then hold me there
for quite so long.

The cinematography is excellent and the story-line is clever in how it develops.
Small hints littered throughout that give just enough for the viewer to be
worried but not so overt to be in your face.

This film is a really excellent horror and ticks all the boxes I think.
Disturbing enough to leave a mark, but still fun, shocking, and sparing use of
jump scares, opting much more to put the danger in plain sight for the viewer,
but concealed for the character.

It is only really the subject matter that makes me rank this lower than
Midsommar. The supernatural always adds an element of comedy almost for me, and
disconnects me from the scare. However I loved the references to The Exorcist
dotted throughout.
