This had been on my watch-list since it's release, and perhaps it was that long
build of anticipation that resulted in my dissatisfaction.

The tale of Reynolds Woodcock and his muse was intriguing, and the winding
narrative kept me entertained. The performances were sublime, Daniel Day-Lewis
once again exhibiting why he has such a reputation (not that anyone was in any
doubt), and Vicky Krieps certainly gave me the creeps with the slightest look.
The cinematography: beautiful. The gorgeous palette of colors, the immaculate
costumes and set...

Yet despite all this, something didn't quite click.

Other works by PTA have had me enthralled. Phantom Thread, despite being a 
perfectly decent watch, didn't leave me with a wow factor. Not feeling that I
must talk about this film with others and ensure they watch it, lest they miss
out. Instead I want people to watch it so I can confirm with them whether I
missed something or not.
