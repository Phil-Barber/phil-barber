Thought this would be a fun quirky film to watch on the eve of Hannah's
birthday. Instead made us both incredibly sad.


The film is a positive one and does make you feel grateful for the loved
ones in your life, and appreciate how hard it must be for people going
through battles with cancer. I would definitely recommend it, however
unless you're a cinema aficionado you will not get (like me) many of
the references.


I don't think this is too big of a detriment to the film. References aside
its funny throughout and the characters are easy to connect with and
have depth. But you will miss out on some of the jokes.
