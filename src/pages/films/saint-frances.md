Absolutely loved this film about a woman in her mid 30's who realises she's
got no direction in life and has run out of ideas. 

Finding it hard to describe what happens in this film in a way that I'm satisfied with.
Maybe I'll come back to it later and have another go.

I thought it handled big, sensitive issues profoundly well. I was deeply
moved by how delicately the tension between her and her boyfriend were handled,
as well as the vulnerability that was ultimately shared with her and the parents
of Frances.

Its an emotional ride but I found the film as a whole tremendously uplifting.
