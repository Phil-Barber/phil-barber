This was a really fun film. Thoroughly enjoyed it.

I found it aspirational which people who know me may not find surprising and
probably roll their eyes at.

I was engaged the entire film. There were laughs throughout while not ever
getting too ridiculous. The story sprinkled through was revealed at a really
nice pace and kept developing in ways that kept me interested.

The ending, although a little trite, was incredibly sweet. A life that I (obnoxiously)
believe and want to live.

My little veg patch will have to expand significantly...
