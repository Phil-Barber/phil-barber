Stress stress stress. This film is great and good fun but be warned that you 
will be on edge the entire time.


Adam Sandler is absolutely superb - maybe it's just compared to his typical
films which are bad at best but this makes him look like an Oscar winner.

A real roller-coaster of a film, but one of those roller-coasters that sort of
throws you around in the corners in an aggressive way to the point where you're
not sure if you're even enjoying it anymore.

My only criticism of this film really is that the final bet is not quite a
believable decision for him to take. However I could go along with it enough
to still enjoy it and the ending is 10/10.
