I'd heard this was a modern Superbad and even though it didn't quite live up
to those lofty heights it was still incredibly funny and thoroughly enjoyable.

The start was a bit rushed, clearly just trying to hurry through to the funnier
parts of the adventure. I think more could have been done in these early scenes
to develop characters a little less obviously.

Once the escapade gets going though its a non-stop romp with multiple belly laugh
moments throughout, all the way to the end.

Great comedic performances from the two front-women who really did lead the film.
The success or failure of this film hinged on their ability to have charisma and
character, and they came across so effortlessly it would have been easy to believe
it was a real duo of pals just having a wild time.

Was also great to see a teen film of this nature that wasn't (solely) lead boy
fancies girl way out of his league and eventually seduce her. This story did
have part of that (with roles reversed), but the main love story was between
Amy and the girl she was going for.

To top it off this film has an excellent soundtrack featuring RTJ, Perfume 
Genius, and Leikeli47 among others.
