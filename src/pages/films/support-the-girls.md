Support the girls is a good film. Full of heart with a really evocative
performance from Regina Hall. This film based in a hookers-esque sports bar,
follows a day in the life of the overlooked head of staff on a day that gets
increasingly worse, despite all her best efforts to brush of the dust and power
through.

That being said, I didn't enjoy it. And I feel bad because it's hardly even the
fault of the film; it's not bad! The problem is that it was advertised to me as
a comedy. Sure there were some funny moments, but this is not what I was looking
for at the time. Had I come into it with the mindset that this is a small story
of a woman making the best of a bad situation with good (albeit basic)
cinematography and a great display of acting talent then maybe things would have
been different.

However, as it was by the time the credits rolled I was left thoroughly
unsatisfied and still craving the blissful release of a full belly-laugh.
