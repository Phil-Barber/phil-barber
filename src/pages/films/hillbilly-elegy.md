Agreed to watch this film with Hannah and her mum to prevent scrolling through
Netflix for another twenty minutes. Having picked up then promptly put down the 
book over the summer I doubted I would enjoy it. I was correct.

The film is pretty bad. All scenarios seem horrendously contrived with no real
flow or subtlety. The performances from Glenn Close and Amy Adams are fine and
help carry the film through, but this feel good story of an underdog does
absolutely nothing to speak to the severity of the issues facing families in
similar situations. With a few flippant references to the prescription opiate
scandal and barely showcasing the plight that recovering drug addicts have 
and their families have to go through. The mothers addiction is merely a tool
to show how amazing our hero is to be securing his dream job with his beautiful
girlfriend.
