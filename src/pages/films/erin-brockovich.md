Enjoyed this as a casual feel good film. Very easy watching. Not gonna
rock your world but not a bad choice if you're at a loss. Julia Roberts
plays the feisty go-getter ex-beauty-queen Erin Brockovich.

From the beginning you get a feel for how she will stop at nothing to
provide for her kids, determined to get a good job the film opens with
her trying to secure a position as a nurse despite no medical training
because she is a "quick learner".

Promptly she is involved in a car accident, a good set up to see her
no bullshit attitude trying to act politely on the stand but her
defensive attitude turns the jury against her, losing her case.

As a result she's plunged into deeper despair, not only having
no job but now in severe debt. Angry at her lawyer for getting her
hopes up she refuses to leave his office until she has a job 

Her tenacity ultimately end up with her being the lead on a national
pollution scandal, securing a record lawsuit against PG&E, resulting
in millions of dollars of compensation being paid out to those that
suffered as a result of the toxic chemicals released into the water.

This film is funny and heartwarming, keeping you engaged as the film
progresses naturally. A solid 7/10.
