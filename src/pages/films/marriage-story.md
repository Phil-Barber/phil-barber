Watched during my recovery from my nose operation, I'm not sure whether it
caught me at a particularly emotional point of my painkiller daze but this film
blew me away. It took only ten minutes for me to effortlessly fall in love with 
this perfect relationship, only to then watch it fall apart. Throughout the
film I was willing with every fibre of my being for these once-soulmates to
just be kind to each other again.

It was terrifying to watch as the most well meaning, amicable separation was
nudged towards the slippery slope of an uncivil divorce. Believable in every 
way, by the 90 minute mark I was left wondering what the point in love even is.
If it can end with you accidentally slashing your forearm open whilst trying to 
convince a custodial investigator what a competant parent you are - is it worth 
it?

The acting in this really is exceptional, I was even able to get over the 
previously unscalable wall that is Adam Drivers voice. I would highly recommend!
