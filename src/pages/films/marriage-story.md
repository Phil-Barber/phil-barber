Watched during my recovery from my nose operation, I'm not sure whether it 
caught me at a particularly emotiounal point of my painkiller daze but this film
blew me away. It took only ten minutes for me to effortlessly fall in love with 
this perfect relationship. Throughout the film I was willing with every fibre of
my being for these once-soulmates to just be kind to each other again. 

It was terrifying to watch as the most well meaning, amicable separation was
nudged towards the slippery slope of an uncivil divorce Believable in every way 
by the 90 minute mark I was wondering what the point in love even is. If it can 
end with you accidentally slashing your forearm open whilst trying to prove what
a competant parent you are to a custododial investigator - is it worth it?

The acting in this really is exceptional, I was even able to the previously 
unscalable wall that is Adam Drivers voice. I would highly recommend!
