With a cast this good I knew I was going to enjoy it, and indeed it was a real
romp. Con artists Irving and Sydney, played by Christian Bale and Amy Adams, 
strike a deal with the FBI to help entrap dirty senators and even mafioso. As 
the con grows and grows with FBI agent Richie DiMaso's (Bradley Cooper) ego, 
Irving gets increasingly anxious. His unpredictable wife threatening to wreck 
carefully laid plans without any knowledge of how much damage she is causing, 
and his ever growing friendship Mayor Polito leave him searching for a way out 
of the mess they've created for themselves.

The film starts by building the relationship between Irving and Sydney.
Seemingly love at first sight they quickly become lovers and business partners,
Sydney longing for a new life revelling in the character she gets to create for 
herself, inventing a whole new persona. It becomes clear that Irving's marriage
is broken, but is duty bound as a father to his son, jepordising that for
no-one.

Richie makes his feelings for Sydney clear from the start, brazenly hitting on
her while she is locked in her cell. Sydney decides to feign the same in order
to keep him sweet. With each appearance and interruption by Irving's wife this
fake but convincing and publicly affectionate relationship is used maliciously
and precisely to hurt Irving.

This film is funny, tense, exciting and heartfelt. One feels a palpable stress
building as things get increasingly out of hand, longing for some way out.  An
easy-to-watch movie that hits all the marks (as it were), and a strong
recommendation. A film like this is never going to blow your mind but I was
pleasantly surprised by just how much I enjoyed it. Brilliantly executed.
