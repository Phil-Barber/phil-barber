Watched this with Hannah as a fun chilled, family friendly movie night (a nice
wind-down for me after [Uncut Gems](../uncut-gems)).


A genre defining classic that niether of us hasd seen, it lived up to
expectations. Bill Murray is in his pomp and gives a great performance, and the
repeating days are done well and different enough not to become tedious which 
was my biggest concern.

Became slightly problematic with the repeated attempts to sleep with Rita which
was probably funny in the 90's but not so much now... The way the story closes
out is where the film is at it's best. The transformation of Phil from grumpy
cynic to doctor cum musician cum all-round-great-guy is fantastic. And the
final scenes where praise is being lavished upon him by everybody in the town
are thoroughly enjoyable.
