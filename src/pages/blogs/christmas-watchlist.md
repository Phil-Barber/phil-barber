Watched a lot over the Christmas break, here's all of it:

- Fourteen Days in May: Intimate and heartfelt record of Edward Earl Johnson's last days before his execution (8/10)
- RBG: Undeniable legal powerhouse, all round legend. Doc itself is a bit plain (7/10)
- The White Helmets: An amazing cause, not an amazing doc (6/10)
- Little Miss Sunshine: Not sure why it took me so long to watch this. Hilarious and lovable (8/10)
- Muppet Treasure Island: A film I watched dozens of times as a child. A barrel of laughs (7/10)
- Home Alone: (8/10)
- Grease: Never realised how lewd this was (6/10)
- Coco: I adore this film, makes me teary (8/10)
- Soul: Quite good, a little convoluted for not much punch. But the message is an important one (7/10)
