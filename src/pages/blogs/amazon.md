*Everybody shops there, but the reasons not to are overwhelming*


The convenience of Amazon has long been their USP. Nowhere else can you get such a variety
of products delivered at the lowest prices with the fewest clicks. However it doesn't
take much investigation to uncover how the sausage is made and what the true cost of this
service really is.

### Why should we care?

Its no secret that high streets in England have been struggling for years:

> Retailers are facing a sustained drop in footfall, with numbers of visitors down over 10% 
> in the last seven years alone.

> the number of shops, pubs and restaurants lying empty is rising at the fastest pace in nearly a decade

*https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/14/number-of-shoppers-on-uk-high-street-falls-by-10-in-seven-years*


But why does it matter if shops close? If they can't compete with online retail
then that's the way it is.

By choosing to spend your money in local shops, you're choosing to give your money to local people.
Providing income to local families and paying local business taxes. This has a direct impact
on disposable income for people in your area, which is linked to crime reduction and overall 
quality of life.  Moreover, by paying local taxes you're helping [fund local schools, repair works
to roads and improving public services](https://reclaimdemocracy.org/local_business_benefits/).


### But Amazon is too good!

Its true, its hard to match the price and customer service guarantee you get when shopping at
Amazon. Rarely do you have a bad experience and if you do, the compensation is hassle free.
But how do they get such low prices and such speedy deliveries?

Well Amazon jobs are terrible. Injuries at Amazon warehouses have been recorded at
[over three times](https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-amazons-own-numbers-reveal-staggering-injury-1840025032)
the industry average! There have been reports of warehouse workers forbidden from having
a toilet break and force to urinate in [plastic bottles](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/amazon-protests-workers-urinate-plastic-bottles-no-toilet-breaks-milton-keynes-jeff-bezos-a9012351.html).
Delivery drivers too are expected to work in gruelling conditions, compelled to
[skip meals, bathroom breaks, and any other form of rest](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-next-day-delivery-deaths)
to meet targets.

There's also precious little job security. Your performance of units processed per
hour is recorded and any deviation from expectations (sometimes expected at up to 
700 units per hour) are written up automatically. Miss the mark a few times and 
[you're out the door](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/05/amazon-workers-protest-unsafe-grueling-conditions-warehouse).
Particularly during the pandemic with the boost to Amazon's retail, workers have been 
working harder.  Amazon workers are directly affected by COVID, working in often 
crowded warehouses with confirmed cases [on a regular basis](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/18/how-amazon-became-a-pandemic-giant-and-why-that-could-be-a-threat-to-us-all).
Amazon announced a £2 per hour wage increase for its workers, but
subsequently [withdrew that in May](https://leftfootforward.org/2020/06/amazon-warehouse-workers-lose-additional-covid-pay/).

There are also fewer jobs required for online retail. There is only about a [minute of human
time](https://money.cnn.com/2016/10/06/technology/amazon-warehouse-robots/index.html)
that goes into sending your parcels. This efficiency sees Amazon planning to hire
[8000 more workers in the UK in 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/03/amazon-steps-up-hiring-spree-with-push-for-7000-new-staff-in-uk)
compared to [125,000 jobs losses from  UK high streets](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/09/almost-125000-uk-retail-jobs-lost-so-far-this-year-study-estimates).


On top of all of this they avoid vast amounts of tax:
> Amazon’s UK services arm paid just £14.5m  in UK corporate taxes in 2019 despite generating 
> revenues of nearly £3bn in the country, according to the company’s latest accounts.

*https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-services-uk-digital-tax-112225843.html*

And 2019 wasn't just an anomaly:
> Amazon has paid only £61.7m corporation tax here in 20 years, while Marks & Spencer 
> forked out more than that last year alone.

*https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/amazon-storm-over-tax-bill-13936012*


When you take all of that into account it really is no surprise that Amazon is able
to undercut it's competition.

As an added burdon to bear, Amazon's premium prime service's main perk is free next
day delivery - which is terrible for the environment! Next day shipping means more
shipping, which means less efficient shipping. By opting for next day delivery
trucks are being sent out that are only half-full which could be avoided with a
[longer delivery window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HOijUtExiM). And what if 
after all that you decide against your purchase? Well you can send it back for free! 
Resulting in even more carbon being released as a direct consequence from that
purchase.


### So where does the money go?

Lockdowns of varying severities are becoming part and parcel of everyday life and our already
suffering high streets are on their last legs. Its more important than ever for you to take
an active stance in deciding who you want to give your money to. All the while Amazon is
profiting from the collapse:
> At the end of July, the company announced that it had doubled its quarterly profits to 
> $5.2bn (£3.95bn), compared with $2.6bn at the same point in 2019. Net sales had risen by 40%.

*https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/18/how-amazon-became-a-pandemic-giant-and-why-that-could-be-a-threat-to-us-all*

Many people saw this fantastic visual of just [how wealthy Jeff Bezos is](https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/),
I recommend taking a look at that now if you haven't already. I'll be surprised if you get
to the end. That page does a great job of demonstrating the insanity of letting any individual
get so wealthy. The amount of good that could be done with a fraction of that money is so 
vast that to ignore it on ideological grounds of free markets is at best extreme obstinacy
and at worst morally bankrupt. In fact your wealth is closer to that of Elon Musk ($90bn)
(the world's fourth wealthiest individual) than his is to Bezos ($195bn).

There's little that can be done by individuals against the wealth of people like Jeff Bezos,
this has to come from central government. Amazon could shut down tomorrow and he wouldn't
bat an eyelid. After all:
> To turn $100 into $110 is work. To turn 100 million into $110 million is inevitable.




**Shopping locally is better for the environment, better for the community, better
for the country and better for the world. Where do you want your money to go?**
