Packed full of jokes and musing of a randy young adult male this book will have
you laughing throughout. The book follows Gyuri as he goes through life in
newly communist Hungary under Stalin up until the uprising in 1956.

From bizarre rambling skits about an eating competition to re-assert dominance
in a small village in rural Hungary to the everyday farce that was communism
you barely have the rest of a few paragraphs between laughs. It must be said
that until the very last section of the book you could be fooled into thinking
the book has no substance beyond this, however enough is done in the final 30
pages to turn this book from something crude into a well rounded novel.

The plot is sparse, exploring snapshots of Gyuri's life from '46 to '56 with 
the opening chapter the only not in chronological order. Gyuri and his team
travel around post-war Hungary playing basketball games against other local
teams, the only motivation for playing basketball being that it means they're
not in the army.

Gyuri is a loveable hapless character plodding through his formative years
mostly trying to get laid. The reader is treated to his thoughts on girls
passing by are a near constant core of the book, for this reason I feel this is
much more of a "boys book". The sex chat is incessant and crass but resonates
with the experience of I think most young boys (exaggerated beyond the point of
misogyny). The pinnacle of this being when Gyuri spots a girl who has thrown
herself off a bridge, he muses that she isn't attractive enough to be worth
saving, but how if she was then she probably wouldn't have done it in the first
place.


The other core character of the book is his best friend Pataki. The know it all,
good at everything, effortlessly cool sidekick. Gyuri idolises him, Pataki can
do no wrong in his eyes. Pulling of stunts like streaking around the government
building and winning basketball games essentially solo, Pataki's character is
a fun spectacle to indulge in. The book does a great job of rounding him out
however, it is left open to decide his role in the plot, personally I take
the view that he is an example of how no-one is truly infallible.

Gyuri's relationship with Jadwiga feels slightly contrived but does enough
to get you to care for the young couple that the ending lands well. The only
female character in the book that goes beyond (but is not exempt from being)
a sexual object, Jadwiga is well developed and likable.
