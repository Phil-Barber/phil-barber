This book is well written and kept me interested throughout. The writing was
precise and intricate. I can understand why English students (like my pals that 
nominated this book) would enjoy this novel. I however did not, it was just too 
depressing.

And don't get me wrong: I like depressing! I listen to depressing music and
watch depressing films. Heck; Hanya Yanagihara's A Little Life is one of my 
favourite books! But Stoner isn't depressing and interesting, it's depressing 
and deeply dreary.

It's the story of a man who floats through life, every now and again making a
decision. Without fail these small attempts to better his life come to nothing,
or even end up in making his life worse.

There is little redeeming in Stoner's life. Everything he loves either drifts
away from him through inaction or is forcefully removed by the hands of others.
Sound like a fun read to you?
