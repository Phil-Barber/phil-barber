An incredibly beautifully written book. The descriptions of the snow landscap of
the fisshing village on San Pedro island had me entranced from the beginning. 
The descriptions of the cedar trees, the fishing port, the courtroom, was 
transportative.
Every character in this book had a depth to them that kept me captivated 
throughout. The young romance betweeen Hatsue and Ishmael had me both in love 
and in pain.
