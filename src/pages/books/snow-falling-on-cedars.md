This book was given to me as a gift on my 26th birthday by my dear friend Will.
His judgemnt I hold in very high regard and I was eager to start. Once again he
didn't disappoint. This serendipitously coincided with my return from LA where
I had been working with a prospective client, Cedars Sinai hospital. Despite 
wincing involuntarily at each mention of cedars, of which there are many, this 
book was a delight.

With hauntingly beautiful descriptions of the snowy landscape, I was transported
to the fishing village of San Pedro Island at the outbreak of the Second World
War. The cedar trees, the fishing port, the courtroom, the people - I was 
entranced.

Each and every character in this book had a depth to them that kept me 
captivated. Every motive seemed justified. I knew each man and woman, from their
childhood to the present like people I had known my whole life. The young 
romance betweeen Hatsue and Ishmael was torturous and fascinating, while never
distracting from the murder trial at hand.
