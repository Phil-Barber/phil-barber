### Don't do dope


This book is _wild_.


Took me a long time to get into, and even then I was always unsure if I was "getting
it" or not... Essentially the world through the eyes of a junky, the book is a series
of vignettes in which bizarre acts occur, usually sexual.

The scenes are shocking to the point of numbing, grotesque sexual acts just becoming
words on a page. I can certainly understand how this become became such a sensation. 
I'm sure to those in the cult it's a masterpiece. My word of advice for the 
layman: strap in, yes it is like this the whole way through, no it doesn't get 
easier.

Overall I'm glad I read it, and actually by the end I was keen to re-read much of it.
The additional context about Bill Burroughs at the end of the restored text added
gave the text a new perspective. I knew he was writing as a man with first hand
knowledge of life on heroin, but i didn't realise quite how seriously addicted he
was.
