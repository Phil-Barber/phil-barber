Yes, would rec.

My longlist:

- start doing what I claim I want to do or stop lying to myself p8
- Why am I doing? Keep my goal to of mind. Optimise for it p11
- Actions show the world who you are, and the world treats you by your actions p28
- Empty time has the potential to be filled with great things. P42
- The standard pace is for chumps p47
- Don't be a donkey p65
- Admit you're still learning - assume you're below average p68
- When you're wrong you're taken somewhere unexpected. You learn something knew. Appreciate being wrong p71
- Everybody's ideas seem obvious to them p81
- Balance happy / smart / useful 
- Don't start a business until people are asking you to p93
- Parenting is for you as much as them p94
- To get smarter you need to get surprised, think in new ways, understand new perspectives p108
- To make a change you have to feel like you're over compensating. Really, you're just balancing p112
- If a goal doesn't change your actions now, it's not a good goal. Find a new variant that excites you p121
- Breath out. Inspiration is not receiving information, it's applying it p123
- Whatever scares you - go do it p126
