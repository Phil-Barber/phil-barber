I feel like I need to address right at the top of this that I am in no place
to be making comments on the racial situation of the US and any comments below
are purely what I took from the book at the moment.

Please don't let this cancel me in 10 years time...

I absolutely loved this book, cover to cover, It had me laughing throughout.
I mean actually laughing, to myself, audibly, like a fool. Bon-bon is a black
man in a small town in LA that is erased from the map, and it is his mission
to put it back.

This book is a fierce and absurd satire of American culture and race in
America. The absurdity if events that take place are funny: getting high in the
supreme court, the party bus for Hominy's birthday, the fact that he rides a
literal horse around, its all a marvel.

However, Paul Beatty claims this book is not a satire, and to focus on the
humour is to skirt around addressing the main topics in this book. The disparity
between black and white in America, particularly in LA where the wealthiest live
technically in the same city, but actually a whole world apart. When you look
again at this book through this non-satirical lens, you realise how dire the
situation is. Its as Armando Iannucci says about doing political satire in the
current age: Reality is simply too absurd.

The fact of the matter is that these events are too close to reality. The
re-segregation of Dickens is a jab at the fact that if you were to go to parts of
LA many would refer to as "the ghetto", it may as well still be segregated!

That's all the racial commentary you'll get from me online...

I also loved how much this book rips into LA. It's a trash city. The City Lites
interlude is a masterpiece of a chapter by the way and is worth reading the
whole book for.

Again - most of my favourite quotes I would be a fool to post publicly on my
