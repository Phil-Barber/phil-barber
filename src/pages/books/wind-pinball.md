These are what Murakami describes as his "Kitchen table novels". They are the
first books he ever wrote, and the opening essay that explains this is just
as wonderful (if not more so) than the two novels that follow. 

That is not to say these weren't both great books. As Murakami states, Hear the
Wind Sing was written by hand and his only manuscript sent to the publisher as
an award submission, that it won. It is just that Hear the Wind Sing very much
reads like someone's first book.

This was my first time reading any Murakami and I knew he was famous for his
relaxed, simplistic style. I know understand what people talk about and why
they revere him. His ability to speak so precisely about a feeling everyone
can experience is truly exceptional. However had I not had the second novel,
Pinball, to follow on with, I would have felt a little bit underwhelmed.

Wind has so little in it really. Its closer to a series of vignette than
it is a novel. And it reads so quickly and so steadily that it all sort of
blurs into one. It all feels profound but you're unable to place your
finger on what exactly it is he's getting at.

Pinball however is much more fleshed out and I enjoyed significantly more.
The set piece at the end in the warehouse is a masterpiece, worth reading the
whole book just for those 10 pages or so (probably less).
