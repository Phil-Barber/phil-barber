This novel had me hooked entirely, not wanting to stop reading. This became 
somewhat problematic for the latter two thirds of the book when chapters stopped
signalling to me that I should.


The book is formed of four parts. The first is set on a country estate on the
day of a family gathering. The cousins are staying over because their mother is 
off having a divorce, and the elder brother is returning home and bringing a guest.
Briony is a budding author cum playwright and smart beyond her years. I really 
enjoyed the parts written from her perspective. There's one particular part
where she talks about how being an author gets to make a direct connection with
the reader's mind through words that was great. Her elder sister Cecilia and the 
groundsman's son Robbie are also back having recently graduated from Cambridge. 
The two are in love without acknowledging it, that is until this day.


This first section is so charming and funny, it was an absolute delight to read
however things famously take an unfortunate turn. Just as Cecilia and Robbie
admit their feelings for each other, in a tragic mistake Briony misidentifies
Robbie as the attacker of one of the cousins, Lola and the first part concludes
with him being driven away in the back of a police car.

Part two is significantly more bleak as we follow Robbie's journey through
France. He is now in the army having served time in prison and on the retreat
through the countryside, guiding two senior officers back to Dunkirk.

The journey is devastatingly hard, and hellish. He sees things no one should 
have to see, but he perseveres, willed home by his dear Cecilia who has stayed
true to him and sending him letters. Since that day Cecilia hasn't spoken to her
family, appalled that they could believe the childish ideas of young Briony.

Despite it's bleak nature this section was fantastic again. The description of
the war from the perspective of a footsoldier was an angle I'd not really been 
exposed to particularly before. The grimness of war. The atrocities you both 
witness, and contribute to. Some really excellent writing.

Finally we rejoin Briony, now a trainee nurse in one of London's hospitals 
Years have passed and she's realised the damage she has caused. A broken family
, and a couple torn apart, all due to her absolute confidence of what she saw 
fleetingly (and she now knows incorrectly) as a 13 year old. Once again I was 
transported into a time I know very little about. The scenes of the hospital 
having to deal with an influx of badly wounded soldiers was captivating.  She 
has decided to retract her confession in the hopes of clearing Robbie's name
and reconnecting with her sister.

Finally we come to Briony many years later. An old author, celebrating her 
birthday, back at the country manor we met her in. It becomes clear that all
we have been reading thus far has been her latest novel. Based closely on the
real events that took place, but sweetened somewhat for the reader's benefit. 
Robbie and Cecilia were never reunited. They were both killed during the war. 

When I realised what was going on I was initially disappointed. "Ooh and it
was all just a dream" I was thinking smugly. I felt such wonderful writing
deserved a more fitting end than such a clich√©. However as the ends were tied
I was won over. This wasn't a lazy ending, it was in fact an intricate work. 
Myriads of details sprinkled throughout the novel coming together and suddenly
being seen with brand new context.
