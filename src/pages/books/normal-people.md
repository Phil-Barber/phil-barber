After the endless advertising around London and hearing friend after friend talk
about how fantastic this book was, it was an easy pick from Hannah's bookshelf 
when deciding what to read next.

The writing is undeniably very enjoyable. Well paced and relatable, I was drawn
in and was empathetic towards the main characters. The first half of the book I
was particularly invested in. Both Connel and Marianne felt incredibly real 
and left me with a heavy heap of nostalgia of my late school days. The feeling
of how the world was and the nerves of leaving a small town, moving away from
my parents to university.

Dissapointingly the second half lost me slightly. I was still invested in the
protagonists but felt less and less that these people were real. Marianne's 
decline felt tragic and I could follow her experiences and they were believable, 
horrible, and saddening.

Connel's however felt somewhat forced and I just couldn't buy it. His 
depressive episodes, although fully justified with the death of a close friend,
didn't have the context and ultimately broke my connection to him. Despite this 
there were still some fantastic scenes. Connel's counselling session was written
perfectly - that sense of hating every moment of being there and yet being 
unable to stop talking.
