I was so invested in the first half of this book. Both Connel and Marianne felt
incredibly real and relatable. So many experiences that dug up deep nostalgia.
The second half lost me slightly. Mariannes decline felt real and tragic, 
Connel's however felt a bit forced and I didn't believe it. Despite this there 
were still some very evocotive scenes. Connel's counselling session was written
perfectly - that sense of hating every moment of being there and yet being 
unable to stop talking because the feeling of being allowed to just say whatever
is on your mind is so cathartic.
