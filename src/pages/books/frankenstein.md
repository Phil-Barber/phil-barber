It was November of 2018 and I was watching a firework display with
some friends. The show hosted annually in Victoria Park centers around a theme, 
and has become something of a tradition for us. The previous year had been in
tribute of David Bowie - featuring a spaceship complete with a trapeze artist 
"Rocket(wo)man".

This year, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Mary Shelley's classic there
towered a wire frame, in which one could make out against a deep navy winter
sky the faint outline of the monster's infamous countenance. By the end of the
evening the face had been illuminated bright green and subsequently burnt down.
I was in awe of the spectacle and decided if the novel was worth these
celebrations it was surely worth reading.

Much like the fireworks, Frankenstein was a delight to experience. Bright
flashes of genius from the main character, Victor Frankenstein, in his endeavour
to understand the secret of life. The wonderful colourful scenery of the Swiss
alps with the meandering Arve, or the rolling English countryside. These were
interspersed with deep dark pits of madness, anxiety and fear. Many times I
was entranced by Frankenstein's dizzying descent into mania.

Having completed the book I'm still uncertain on the protagonist. Obviously the 
widely agreed opinion is that Frankenstein is the *real* monster, and there's no
denying he's not the nicest of fellows. However I feel like the creature gets
far too easy a ride in this analysis (let's not forget the numerous murders
he committed throughout). I have no doubt that Frankenstein made the correct
call in not creating a second!
