Really enjoyed the constant near panic attacks of our dear Frankenstein. The
detailed descriptions of the blissful Chamonix countryside contrasted
beautifully with the mental breakdowns and depths of torment he experienced.
I'm not sure how much I back the "monster-isn't the real monster" analysis.
I think it's reasonable to say they were both pretty nasty creatures
