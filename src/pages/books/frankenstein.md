It was November of 2018 and I was watching a firework display with
some of my friends. The free event hosted in Victoria Park something that has 
becomecome a tradition, each year putting on a fantastic show centered aroudn a 
theme. The previous year had been in tribute of David Bowie - featuring a
spaceship complete with a trapeze artist "Rocket(wo)man".

This year, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Mary Shelley's classic there
towered an wire frame, in which one could make out against the deep navy winter 
sky the faint outline of the monster's infamous countenance. By the end of the 
evening the face had been illuminated bright green and subsequently burnt down. 
I was in awe of the spectacle and decided if the novel was worth these 
celebrations it was surely worth reading.

Much like the fireworks, Frankenstein was a delight to experience. Bright 
flashes of genius from the main character in his endeavour to 
understand the secret of life. The wonderful colourful scenery of the swiss 
alps with the meandering Arve, or the rolling English countryside. These were
intersperesed with deep dark pits of madness, anxiety and fear. Many times I 
was entranced by Frankensteins dizzying decent into mania.

Having completed the book I'm still uncertain on the protagonist. Obviously the 
widely agreed opinion is that Frankenstein is the *real* monster, and there's no
denying he's not the nicest of fellows. However I feel like the creature gets 
far too easy a ride in this analysis (let's not forget the numerous murders 
he committed throughout). I have no doubt that Frankenstein made the correct 
call in not creating a second!
