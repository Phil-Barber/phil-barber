What a wonderful read. The memoir of old, dying Reverand John Ames intended as
an extended letter to his 7 year old son. The meandering musings about God,
Christianity, Atheism, meaning, and life had me in deep thought throughout.


The first half of the novel Ames is present, in awe of the world around him.
He sees the beauty in all things, the miracle of life on earth and nature, the
image of God in all things. I really enjoyed this section of the book. It speaks
to a lot of things that I try and manifest in my own life, seeing the good in
all things. We all have our own lives, our own shortcomings, but there is good
in everyone.


Then his namesake Jake Boughton (John Ames Boughton) reappears back in the small
town of Gilead after years of nothing, the prodigal son returning to the side
of his dying father - Ames' best friend. But why? What's he after?

It is clear from the moment Jack appears that there has been a tense history
between them. There are several attempts made by Jack to reach out, to discuss
faith. Can people be saved? Are some people predestined for hell?


This presence disturbs John. His writing becomes less and less focussed on the
world around him as he gets increasingly tied up on Jack. Despite his best
efforts he has great difficulty seeing the good in the man, stating "More prayer
is in order".


To me this demonstrates how easy it is for people to get swept up in the facile,
to lose sight of what is important in life, the beauty in people. It is revealed
in a long exposition scene at the end of the book the Jack has been trying to
turn his life around and is facing his own hardships. For me it again reinforces
the idea that people are fallible, and one should always assume the best in
anyone.


I loved this book. The discussion of faith and what it means to believe in God
put forward in these pages managed to approach the subject in ways I hadn't
considered before. As an arrogant teen I certainly was swept up in the
"fashion of the times" and thought so confidently that atheism was the only
logical belief of a thinking man. As time goes by and I'm reconnecting with
my own spirituality, my own definition of faith and what that word means to me,
I was grateful for these new perspectives (at least new to me) on an age old
argument.
