I read this in only a few weeks, desperately trying to blast through the pages
before my next book club selection. Its very small and structured with only a
paragraph or two per page so it was quite easy to get through however I think I
took it a bit too far and didn't completely take it all in. 

Written in this way the author is packing a surprising amount into not very 
many words, and to read it how I did I'm sure I missed things. There were many
moments that I really enjoyed still, some very amusing similies and the simple
plot still resonated with me. The affair(?) was delivered brilliantly and left 
open, and her relationship to her husband and son had me thinking a lot. 

It was a good example of how people see themselves. Everyone is the center of 
their own universe, all stories have themselves as the protagonist. How does
this affect their perception of reality?

There is a lot of humour in these pages, and a lot of deep, resounding sadness.
