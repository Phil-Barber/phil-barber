# Look! It&apos;s a website all about me
Hello and welcome.

This is a work in progress site, beginning as a 100 days of
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/tags/100-days-of-gatsby/)
project. I'm using it mainly as a way to keep track of films and books I've been
enjoying. These are not going to be interesting reviews - more reminders for
myself of what I thought. The sad truth is my memory is so poor that unless
I write down what I thought of something, I might not realise I've even read it.


Check out the code for this page [here](https://github.com/Phil-Barber/phil-barber/)!
It's nothing particularly special but could interest you I suppose.


I won't be offended that you've already noticed that I'm definitely **not** a
designer. I did my best with the colours OK, I'd appreciate it if we could just
leave it at that.


If you want to learn about my career check out my
[Linkedin]|(https://uk.linkedin.com/in/philip-barber-827581b1?).  I'm
particularly interested in conributing to social enterprises and good causes.
If there's an opportunity you think would interest me, hit me up using the
[contact form](./contact).


For probably more interesting info on me you could view my
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/phil12321?si=lSLEs-7NTIKbVMVWTP-LBA)
or my
[IMDB watchlist](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46443696/watchlist?ref_=nv_usr_wl_all_0).


Thanks for stopping by!
