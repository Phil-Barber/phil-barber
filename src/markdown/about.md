# Look! It&apos;s a website all about me
Hello and welcome.

This website began as a "100 days of
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/tags/100-days-of-gatsby/)"
project. I was using it as a way to keep track of films and books I had been
enjoying, however as with most side projects, eventually you run out of steam.

These reviews are not interesting or particularly well written. They are
instead reminders to myself of what I thought at the time. The sad truth is my
memory is akin to a fruit fly's and so unless I write down what I thought of
something, I might not recall it at all.

Now this page exists as a bit of a vanity project, although it only showcases
pretty rudimentary javascript and css. I won't be offended that you've already
noticed I'm definitely **not** a designer. I did my best with the colours OK,
and I'd appreciate it if we could just leave it at that.

Check out the code for this page [here](https://github.com/Phil-Barber/phil-barber/).

Thanks for stopping by!
