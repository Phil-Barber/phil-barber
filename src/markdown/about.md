# Look! It&apos;s a website all about me
Impressive and confusing that you've ended up here. Not much
to see yet.


This is a work in progress site, beginning as a 100 days of
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/tags/100-days-of-gatsby/)
project. You can find recent books and films I've been
enjoying, perhaps more in the future.


horrendous spelling and you'll be sure to find a few (many)
spelling errors. Feel free to open a
[PR](https://github.com/Phil-Barber/phil-barber/)!


I won't be offended that you've already noticed that I'm definitely **not** a 
designer. I did my best with the colours OK, I'd appreciate it if we could just 
leave it at that.


Full disclosure: this is a work in progress and you shouldn't expect most (if 
any) of these links to actually work.


Thanks for stopping by!
