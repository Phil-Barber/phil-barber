# What I'm doing now
_(This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about))_


## Infogrid

Infogrid is building modern solutions to improve the environmental impact of
the built environment. I've predominantly been working on the Occupancy
solution, serving meaningful aggregations of large datasets.

Infogrid has some fantastic employees and I feel very fortunate to work here. 
I've been able to learn a tonne from those around me, most excitingly in domain
driven design and data intensive applications.

Recent projects include moving legacy data aggregations out of Python and into
the database. We're also building a data pipeline to build data models using
Snowflake and DBT, then consuming those models in Cube, a headless-BI tool.

## Moving house

I'm currently in the middle of moving house which is always a challening period,
a truism I'm just beginning to fully appreciate. It feels like the past 3 months
I've had precious little headspace to do other things but it will all be worth it
in the end... right?


## Nice

Enjoyed a terrific working holiday in Nice over the early May bank holiday with
5 days work, 5 days play. A beautiful city with great access to other
destinations in the CÃ´te d'Azur.

Drank lots of delicious wine, indulged in lots of cheese, and plentiful flakes
of buttery pastry. I would reccomend **highly**.
