# What I'm doing now
_(This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about))_


## Mindfulness

The end of 2020 was really stressful for me. The Vaccine roll-out meant a whole
load of new urgent work to be done plus putting together a roadmap for 2021.
Long stressful hours meant I carried that stress with me when work finished.

My aim for this quarter is to retain the calm I cultivated over the Christmas 
break. I've been trying to meditate twice daily, and am doing some form of 
exercise every day (usually yoga).

*Update* [2021-04-04] Have been using the Waking Up app for about 3 months now
and I've found it invaluable. I'd highly recommend it.

## Treepoints
I'm on 4 days a week at Lantum and I'm using my 5th day to take a break from my
manager schedule and get some much needed maker time at Treepoints.

Treepoints is a new business that aims to give people an affordable, convenient
and rewarding way to offset their carbon.


## Lantum

Engineering Manager on one of two squads, responsible for delivery of high 
quality features with unforgiving deadlines. It's all systems go for us at the
moment to reach the start-up Mecca: product market fit.

Currently hiring aggressively so if you know or yourself are a developer and 
Lantum sounds interesting to you, hit me up!

### More on Lantum
Temporary staffing in the NHS is a [huge cost](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/clampdown-on-nhs-staffing-agency-costs) due to the crisis in available staff. Lantum aims to 
reduce those costs drastically, as well as dragging healthcare institutions into 
the future - replacing tedious pen and paper rotas an manual uploads with fully
digital and seamless staff scheduling.
