# What I'm doing now
_(This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about))_


## Learning

Lockdown has been a magnificent time for self development. I've done a lot of
introspection and spending more time doing things I enjoy:
- reading
- watching
- listening
- learning.


My company was forced earlier this year to temporarily reduce our hours to 80%
due to _THE VIRUS_. This made me realise that actually, more time for me and 
less time at work is actually... quite nice. So after being brought back up to 
full time, I swiftly reduced my hours again. Let's see where it takes me!


Speaking of my job:


## Lantum

Currently working 4 days a week at [lantum](http://lantum.com/) with the aim
to unite the world's healthcare workers on a single platform.

I work on both the React (and legacy AngularJS ðŸ¤¢) front end and a
micro-services based back end (90% Python Django), as well as being a key 
influencer in our technical decisions and specifications. 

I line-manage 2 lovely people and the dev team is a total of around 10 equally 
lovely people.

### More on Lantum
Temporary staffing in the NHS is a [huge cost](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/clampdown-on-nhs-staffing-agency-costs) due to the crisis in available staff. Lantum aims to 
reduce those costs drastically, as well as dragging healthcare institutions into 
the future - replacing tedious pen and paper rotas an manual uploads with fully
digital and seamless staff scheduling. 


## Cycling

I've rediscovered how thoroughly enjoyable cycling can be! Many of my friends
have now taken up the sport and it's a super convenient way for us to close the
physical gap between us and meet for a take-away pint. 

It was also one of the few ways to escape lockdown and resulted in a mini cycle
tour through the beautiful Norfolk Broads, wild camping for 3 days. The highest
ration of [punctures](/puncture.jpg) to kilometers I've ever known
