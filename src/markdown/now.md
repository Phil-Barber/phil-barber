# What I'm doing now
_(This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about))_


## Learning

The so called new normal is now stale and lost all meaning. This is life now.

Permenantly working from home is something I enjoy and would have seized with 
both hands 12 months ago - but even I would enjoy seeing my colleagues in the
flesh again after so much time virtually waving to each other, grinning like
fools to a screen, all desperate to reach out from our imposed isolations.

Still venturing up to London to see my pals as and when I can which has been a
welcome shift. I'm writing this on the eve of "tier 2 restrictions"Â© so we'll
see what happens next.


## Lantum

Lead developer on one of three squads, responsible for delivery of high quality 
features with unforgiving deadlines. It's all systems go for us at the moment
to reach the start-up Mecca: product market fit.

Currently on 9-days a week, keeping myself busy in that 10th day with things
like this and going to cafes and eating an unreasonable amount of cake.

### More on Lantum
Temporary staffing in the NHS is a [huge cost](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/clampdown-on-nhs-staffing-agency-costs) due to the crisis in available staff. Lantum aims to 
reduce those costs drastically, as well as dragging healthcare institutions into 
the future - replacing tedious pen and paper rotas an manual uploads with fully
digital and seamless staff scheduling. 


## Riff

For the past 3 months I was working 1 day a week at a new startup called Riff. 
They are one of the many new players in the remote-work communication space,
focussing on "voice first" contact.

It was a fun period of writing NodeJS using the google voice to text API. I
learnt a lot about node streams, buffers and how various audio encodings work.
