## Mindfulness

The end of 2020 was really stressful for me. The Vaccine roll-out meant a whole
load of new urgent work to be done plus putting together a roadmap for 2021.
Long stressful hours meant I carried that stress with me when work finished.

My aim for this quarter is to retain the calm I cultivated over the Christmas 
break. I've been trying to meditate twice daily, and am doing some form of 
exercise every day (usually yoga).


## Lantum

Lead developer on one of two squads, responsible for delivery of high quality 
features with unforgiving deadlines. It's all systems go for us at the moment
to reach the start-up Mecca: product market fit.

Coronavirus has impacted us both negatively and positively, and new NHS funding 
initiatives mean there is more to do than ever.

Currently on 9-days a week, keeping myself busy in that 10th day with things
like this ~and going to cafes and eating an unreasonable amount of cake~.

### More on Lantum
Temporary staffing in the NHS is a [huge cost](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/clampdown-on-nhs-staffing-agency-costs) due to the crisis in available staff. Lantum aims to 
reduce those costs drastically, as well as dragging healthcare institutions into 
the future - replacing tedious pen and paper rotas an manual uploads with fully
digital and seamless staff scheduling.
